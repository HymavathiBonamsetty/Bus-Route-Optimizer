# Bus-Route-Optimizer

Bus Route Planner

Description
The Bus Route Planner helps compute optimal routes between bus stops using efficient graph algorithms. It allows users to plan bus trips, find shortest paths, and manage multiple bus lines easily.

Features

Add bus stops and define routes with distances or travel times.

Compute shortest paths between any two bus stops.

Support for multiple bus lines and directional routes.

Efficient graph-based algorithms for route planning (Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm).

Flexible and scalable design for adding more routes and stops.

Technologies Used

C++

Standard Template Library (STL) for data structures like vectors, maps, and priority queues.

Usage

Clone the repository:

git clone <repository-url>


Compile the code:

g++ -std=c++17 BusRoutePlanner.cpp main.cpp -o bus_planner


Run the executable:

./bus_planner


Follow console prompts to add routes and compute shortest paths.

Future Enhancements

Integration with a web interface (Javascript/React)

Visualization of routes and stops
