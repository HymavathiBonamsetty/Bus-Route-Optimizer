# Bus-Route-Optimizer

## Description
The Bus Route Planner helps compute optimal routes between bus stops using efficient graph algorithms. It allows users to plan bus trips, find shortest paths, and manage multiple bus lines easily.

## Features
- Add bus stops and define routes with distances or travel times.
- Compute shortest paths between any two bus stops.
- Support for multiple bus lines and directional routes.
- Efficient graph-based algorithms for route planning (Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm).
- Flexible and scalable design for adding more routes and stops.

## Technologies Used
- C++
- Standard Template Library (STL) for data structures like vectors, maps, and priority queues.

## Usage

1. **Clone the repository:**
```bash
git clone <repository-url>

2. Compile the code:

g++ -std=c++17 BusRoutePlanner.cpp main.cpp -o bus_planner

3. Run the executable:

./bus_planner

4. Follow console prompts to add routes and compute shortest paths.

Sample Output
Enter source stop: A
Enter destination stop: D
Shortest path from A to D:
A -> B -> C -> D
Total distance: 15

5. Future Enhancements

Integration with a web interface (JavaScript/React)

Visualization of routes and stops
